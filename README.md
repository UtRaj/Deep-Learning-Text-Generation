# Text generation using Recurrent Neural Networks

The project demonstrates how to generate text using a character-based Recurrent Neural Network . The Dataset used is a Shakespeare's writing from Andrej Karpathy's The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks. Given a sequence of characters from this data, we aim to predict the next character in the sequence.

## Project Objectives:

1. Generate text using RNN.
2. Create a training example and target for text generation.
3. Build a RNN model for sequence generation using Keras Subclassing.
4. Create a text generator and evaluate the output.
 

## Technologies Used:

1. Python3.10

2. TensorFlow

3. Numpy

4. RNN
